Gif This!
=====

Gif This! is a chrome extension that queries the [Giphy API](https://github.com/giphy/GiphyAPI) to display gifs and .

## Why use Giphy?

Giphy offers an easy way to search for gifs and also offers a simple to use API.

### The API calls we used

- Search
  We allow the user to search for any string and we output at most 6 gifs related to the search query
  
- Trending
  We query Giphy for their trending gifs and show them to the user.

- Random
  We show a single gif that the random API call delivers. 
  Because it's only 1 the gif takes the whole width of the extension instead of being in one of the 2 columns.

## Paste it anywhere
  By clicking a gif the gif url is copied to the users clipboard and can be pasted in any website, chat or other interface that accepts gifs.
